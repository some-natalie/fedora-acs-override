# Security Policy

## About

:warning: Using this kernel patch, as the name of this repository implies, overrides the isolation of devices in memory.  You should understand the [potential risks](https://vfio.blogspot.com/2014/08/iommu-groups-inside-and-out.html) for security and stability before using it.

## Supported Versions

I make a best effort to keep up to date with the latest Fedora release and kernel, but please don't assume this is anything more than a hobbyist tinkering around in the kernel for fun. :heart:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I am not a kernel developer and you should report any problems not _directly_ related to this patch upstream.  Please see the Fedora Project's [security reporting guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security_Bugs#Reporting_a_Security_Vulnerability) for guidance.
